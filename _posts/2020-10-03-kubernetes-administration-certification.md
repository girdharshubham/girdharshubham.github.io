I've been dodging taking the CKA test for months now and I feel like it's about time that I got serious about it. It's not because I'm at a stage in my career where I should definitely be aiming for some industry accepted certifications, but because the coupon for the test is going to expire this December :P. I gather I have about a month to prepare for it and I plan on creating a journal for whatever I prepare and learn just so I have somewhere to look for that knowledge when the time comes.  
  
The first thing that I'd need is a Kubernetes cluster. For that I'd be using a Minikube environment on docker - which I think has become the default option.  
  
Here's to starting this preparation journey and hoping that I end up with something more than just a certification.  
Cheers!
